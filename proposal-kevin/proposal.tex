\section*{1. Motivation}
Advancing smart agriculture through the use of real sensor data is crucial for improving farm management, animal welfare, and resource optimization. By focusing on cattle farms, this research aims to leverage sensor data to enhance operations, ensure animal welfare, and manage resources more effectively, facilitating smarter decision-making.


\section*{2. Problem Statement}

Modern cattle farming faces significant challenges in resource management, animal welfare, and operational efficiency. Existing data management solutions often lack the advanced analytics and monitoring capabilities needed to support effective decision-making. These limitations include high costs, compatibility issues with farm-specific devices, and insufficient integration with advanced data collection technologies.

Our proposed platform seeks to address these issues by integrating with the WeideInsight system, utilizing technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and mioty for precise data collection. This platform is designed to provide comprehensive, data-driven decision-making tools tailored specifically for cattle farming. It distinguishes itself from existing platforms like \textbf{Digitanimal}, \textbf{Performance Livestock Analytics (PLA)}, \textbf{Livestocked}, \textbf{NAVFARM}, \textbf{Farm Manager and Analyzer}, \textbf{AGEX Herd}, \textbf{Ranch Manager}, and \textbf{ThingsBoard} by offering specialized, cost-effective features that meet the unique requirements of this sector.

\textbf{Research Question:} How can a data-driven platform be developed to enhance decision-making in cattle farm management through advanced monitoring, analytics, and simulation capabilities?
