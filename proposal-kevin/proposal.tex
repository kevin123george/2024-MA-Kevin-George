\section*{1. Motivation}
This research aims to enhance smart agriculture systems by integrating real sensor data into simulations, recognizing patterns, detecting anomalies, and ensuring data quality. Focusing on cattle farms, the goal is to optimize sensor data to improve farm operations, animal welfare, and resource management. The transformation of traditional agriculture through IoT and sensor technologies enables precise monitoring and management, addressing challenges in data integration, quality assurance, and anomaly detection for better decision-making and operational efficiency.
